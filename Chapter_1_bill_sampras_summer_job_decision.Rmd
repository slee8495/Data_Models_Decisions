## **Take a quick glance of this case study and analysis.**

<br>


**What kind of problem are we solving, what is the story?** <br>

We are tackling a decision analysis problem to determine the best summer employment option for Bill Sampras, a student at Sloan School of Management at MIT. The story unfolds as Bill must decide between accepting a guaranteed but possibly less lucrative summer job offer from his former boss, John Mason, or waiting for a potentially better offer from Vanessa Parker of an investment banking firm, with the risk of ending up having to search for another job through his school's recruiting program. <br>

**What is the goal of the analysis?**
<br>

The goal is to construct and analyze a decision tree that represents Bill's summer job options to help him make an informed choice based on his preference for a higher summer salary. The decision tree will systematically represent and evaluate the sequence of decisions and uncertainties Bill faces, guiding him to a decision that maximizes his salary expectations. <br>
