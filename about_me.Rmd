Hello! I'm Sangho Lee, a dedicated data analyst at Ventura Foods where I currently enhancing business processes at Ventura Foods and a bit of an R enthusiast.

<br><br> My data journey didn't start in a classroom; it began hands-on, with lots of coding and real-world problem-solving. Keen to dive deeper, I headed to UC San Diego for a Master's in Business Analytics, which turned out to be a fantastic playground for my data-driven curiosity.

At Ventura Foods, my day-to-day is all about making things easier and more insightful through automation and dashboards, thanks to the magic of R and R Shiny. I believe in the power of data to tell stories and guide decisions, and I love turning complex data into clear, actionable insights.

This website? It's my digital sandbox. Inspired by "Data, Models, and Decisions" by Dimitris Bertsimas and Robert M. Freund, it's where I unpack case studies using R and Python, hoping to spark conversations and share a-ha moments about data and decisions in the business world.

<br><br>When I'm not crunching numbers or codings, you'll likely find me on the golf course or cheering for the LA Dodgers. Golf is my way to unwind -- there's nothing like the peace of hitting the fairways, and every round is a new adventure. It's my mini-vacation from the daily grind.

Speaking of excitement, I'm a huge baseball fan, especially of the LA Dodgers. My first game at Dodger Stadium was an unforgettable experience -- the energy, the fans, and that unforgettable feeling of being part of something bigger. It's been a thrill ride ever since! üèåÔ∏è‚öæ

<br> <br> Back at home, life is a bundle of joy, thanks to Brownie, my adorable miniature poodle. She's the little boss of the house, always up for food and treats or a cozy nap. Her existence at home absolutely gives me the joy! üê∂

And of course, there's my better half -- my wonderful wife. We're a great team, enjoying life's simple pleasures, from exploring new places to just chilling at home. So, that's a slice of my life outside the office -- a mix of sports, puppy love, and great times with my wife.
