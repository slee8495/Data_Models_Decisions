Hi, I’m Sangho Lee, a data-driven problem solver and Manager of Analytics & Performance Optimization at Hyundai Motors America. My passion lies in transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

<br> I didn’t start my career in a classroom—I started hands-on, tackling real-world problems through coding, analytics, and automation. This passion led me to pursue a Master’s in Business Analytics at UC San Diego, where I deepened my expertise in statistical modeling, machine learning, and business intelligence.

<br><br>

This site is an extension of my passion for analytics—a space where I document my study notes, industry insights, and personal interpretations of data-driven decision-making. While inspired by Data, Models, and Decisions by Dimitris Bertsimas and Robert M. Freund, it goes beyond the book, incorporating my own experiences and real-world applications.

My goal is to make analytics engaging, insightful, and practical, breaking down complex concepts into actionable takeaways.

<br>

When I’m not working with data, I enjoy watching baseball (Go Dodgers!), football (Go Rams!), and binge-watching Netflix. At home in Orange County, California, I spend time with my wife, Kristen, and our little baby, Brownie. We love discovering great food spots in Southern California, but also enjoy quiet days at home.
