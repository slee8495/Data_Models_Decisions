### Welcome to my Business Analytics & Decision Making Website

<br>

This website is a collection of my study notes, experiences, and insights into the world of data-driven decision-making. While it was inspired by Data, Models, and Decisions by Dimitris Bertsimas and Robert M. Freund—a book I first encountered during my Business Analytics Master’s program at UCSD Rady School—it has grown into much more than just an exploration of its case studies.

Here, I document my personal interpretations, solutions, and key takeaways from various business analytics challenges, blending theory with real-world applications. My goal is to create a space that is both informative and engaging, where complex concepts become approachable and practical.

I’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or engage in discussions—feel free to reach out at [businessanalyticsslee\@gmail.com](mailto:businessanalyticsslee@gmail.com).
